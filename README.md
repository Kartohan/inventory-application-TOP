# inventory-app-TOP-project

I did it!
It was very interesting. I learned a lot of things during this project. The most difficult part was working with the module "multer" and "express-validator" It took me many hours to understand how to properly validate images. I'm very happy to present my project to you!

The project was done as described in the description, based on the [previous one](https://github.com/Kartohan/express-locallibrary-tutorial), but I did a lot of things that were not in the previous project.
What was done:

1. All assignment to this project was done, included "extra credit"
2. Project styles were done with Tailwind
3. Image uploading with multer.
4. Image validation.
5. Administrator access.
6. Randomize items on index

What i used:

1. Express/express modules, Pug.
2. Mongoose and MongoDB for Database.
3. Tailwind for styling.
4. Multer for uploading images.
5. etc.

What else can be done:

1. Different screen support, phone support.
2. Maybe comments and rate system.
